    <description>Direct questions, real answers. On with Kara Swisher is where “Silicon Valley’s most feared and well-liked journalist” gets to the heart of what makes powerful people tick. Kara makes sense of tech, business and politics through tough conversations with the newsmakers who matter.

      <title>Into It: A Portrait of Artist as Taylor Swift</title>
      <description>Today, we’re sharing a special episode of Into It: A Vulture Podcast with Sam Sanders about one of Kara’s favorites: Taylor Swift.

What is the meaning of Taylor Swift? She's performed damsel in distress, but represents women’s empowerment. She’s a confessional artist, but is careful about how much she reveals. She's an adult, but is often still viewed as the teenager she used to be. On the eve of Midnights, Sam dives into the mythos and craft of Taylor Swift with NPR music critic Ann Powers about her place in history among the likes of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Adele, and Beyoncé.

We also hear about the culture that's haunting us: Explain to us again why Bobby Cannavale's character in The Watcher wants to replace a Carrara marble countertop with butcher block? To make red sauce?

      <title>Where’s the Line in Comedy? Monty Python’s Eric Idle Has an Idea</title>
      <description>Should anything be off-limits in comedy? Kara and Nayeema discuss this question, and the recent Dave Chappelle SNL monologue, before Kara’s interview with our guest today: writer-comedian Eric Idle who is an OG in the craft. When he and his fellow sketch artists launched Monty Python on the BBC in 1969, it was unclear whether anyone would even watch. Now there are generations of Python fans. Today, Idle talks about what made Monty Python unique and how they pushed the line and the social conversation with their unique brand of humor. 
Both avid Twitterers, Kara and Idle also discuss their frustrations with Elon Musk (he’s a noted fan of Monty Python, though Idle is not a fan of Musk). And Idle describes how his recent bout with pancreatic cancer has made him a more accepting person.

      <title>Can Chris Licht Turn CNN Around?</title>
      <description>Chris Licht faces an uphill battle at CNN. He got the CEO gig in the midst of a prickly merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery and right after the shocking exit of beloved long-time boss, Jeff Zucker. In his first six months, he’s shut down CNN+, ousted Brian Stelter, and shuffled anchors around, including Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. This week, the network chief held an internal town hall meeting where he faced a staff of thousands and discussed upcoming layoffs. Shortly afterwards, he sat down with Kara — who grilled him, of course. 
She asks Licht whether he has any real actual power or if he’s simply executing orders from Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav — who is in search of cuts, as the company stares down the barrel at $50 billion in debt — and billionaire board member, John Malone, who has said he’d like to see more “centrist” programming from CNN. They discuss Licht’s vision for the newsroom, his plan to build trust with journalists who fear losing jobs, and how CNN will cover Donald Trump during the 2024 election.  
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema discuss the challenges facing journalism in an era of disinformation. Stay tuned for Kara’s closing rant on “citizen journalism” and Elon’s latest broadside against the press.

      <title>Elon Musk: Somebody That I Used to Know</title>
      <description>Elon Musk is a puzzle, but if there’s anyone who can make sense of him it’s Kara Swisher. She’s covered him since the late 90s – back in her early days as a beat reporter at the Wall Street Journal and she’s had many in-depth interviews and exchanges with the tech titan since, perhaps more than any other reporter. She’s also covered Elon’s latest fiefdom, Twitter, before it even was Twitter. So today we turn the tables, and Kara Swisher is “On” with Nayeema Raza. 

We’ll unpack how Elon became Elon, why Kara came to believe he was one of the greatest visionaries in Silicon Valley, when exactly she soured on him — and why she still holds out some hope.

      <title>How Donald Trump Helped the Democrats</title>
      <description>After Kara and Nayeema have a chat about — what else? — Elon Musk’s latest moves, we dive into democracy and the midterms. The results are (mostly) in, and the “red wave” that Republicans predicted never came. To understand why, Kara gets deep into political reporting in three key swing states: Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
Our guests are three veteran journalists who know their respective states' politics inside out: Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, democracy reporter covering Arizona for The Washington Post; Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and Chris Potter, government and accountability editor for WESA FM, Pittsburgh’s NPR news station. Together, the panel unpacks the midterm results and the decision by Democrats to focus on democracy, Dobbs and, yes, Donald Trump.
Plus, stay tuned for Kara’s RANT about why she’s savoring John Fetterman’s win — and why President Biden deserves more credit than he’s gotten.

      <title>How John King Gets Ready for Election Night</title>
      <description>Kara is nervous about the elections — and she should be, control of the House and of the Senate is up for grabs, as are 36 governorships. She and Nayeema discuss the big day ahead, and specifically how social media and misinformation may sway results.

They then turn to our guest today — the man who will be sharing those results with us, at least on CNN. John King and Kara talk about how he prepares to helm the “Magic Wall” and talk millions of viewers through the red and blue board. They go beyond the horse race and inside the pressure and process for making calls at CNN. 

Stay tuned for the end of the episode when Kara answers a listener question about her spirituality and Nayeema surmises the sunglassed-one’s Holy Trinity (it’s not what you think). 

If you want Kara’s advice, call 1-888-KARA-PLZ and leave a message. 

You can find Kara and Nayeema on Twitter @karaswisher and @nayeema. Oh yes, and if you’re eligible: GO VOTE!

      <title>Kara on Elon and John Legend on Kanye (and More!)</title>
      <description>Kara and Nayeema kick off this Thursday’s episode with a feisty discussion about Elon Musk’s Twitter and how he’s “kicking the most active users in the teeth.” They give us the run-down inside Elon’s band of merry advisors and Nayeema gets to the heart of why exactly Kara is so angry with Elon … and so sad.

Today’s interview is with John Legend, the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony-winning artist (aka EGOT) who famously moonlights as a social justice activist. But before he was John Legend, he was John Roger Stephens: born to a socially conservative family, sent to an Ivy League university at age 16, and dabbling as a nerdy strategy consultant before his big break. In fact, the first person to credit him as “John Legend” was Kanye West. In this conversation, Kara and John speak about Kanye’s descent into antisemitism and how he makes sense of a friend he’s long last touch with. They also discuss how TikTok has changed the music business, and why John is so hyper-focused on politics and down-ballot midterm races (no, the artist has no plans to run for political office – he’s just downright worried about the country).

Trigger warning: Kara does not hold back on her anger about Twitter and Elon these days, especially at the very end – so make sure you stay tuned for her final choice words ... or, as she calls it, her “rant!” 

Disclosure: John Legend is on the board of directors at Vox Media. This did not change the nature of  our interview. In fact, Kara started with what were probably the hardest questions for him.

      <title>Matt Levine on Elon Musk: Chief Twit &amp; “Meme Lord”</title>
      <description>The Twitter deal is done, and Elon Musk is now, officially, “Chief Twit.” Bloomberg Opinion columnist and “MoneyStuff” writer, Matt Levine, has been analyzing the deal (and the drama) over the past seven months. Now, Matt and Kara consider what the future of the social media platform might look like under Musk. They discuss whether Elon’s seemingly genuine belief in the utility of Twitter, paired with his business and engineering acumen, will be a game changer for the company. And they discuss how his principles will drive big decisions ahead, including potentially reversing the platform's ban of Donald Trump. 
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the rising tide of violence against politicians. Plus, Kara gives Elon some unsolicited advice on the business, including how to avoid a version of Twitter that would make even Kara quit her favorite social media platform.

      <title>Frank Luntz, Rick Wilson and Sarah Longwell on Donald Trump and the Midterms</title>
      <description>Election Day is less than two weeks away, and Republicans are poised for some major midterm gains. So today, Kara talks to three Republican strategists about midterm predictions and the effect that Donald Trump is having on these elections. Our guests are veteran pollster Frank Luntz, Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson, and Bulwark publisher Sarah Longwell. All three are long-time Republican operatives who believe that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and to the party but they disagree on whether and how the party can move beyond MAGA and the Big Lie. 

Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about what Rishi Sunak’s rise to prime minister means for the UK and Nick Clegg: the Meta executive who will decide if Donald Trump’s stays banned from Facebook beyond January 2023. Plus, Kara shares her unsolicited advice for more civil, less cruel, political discourse.

      <title>Twitter Spaces On: WTF is Happening in the UK and the World</title>
      <description>Today, we’re sharing a bonus episode of Kara’s Twitter Spaces conversation recorded on Monday night. In the first part of the conversation, Kara talks to Jonathan Freedland, a British journalist and columnist for The Guardian, about the fall of Liz Truss, the rise of Rishi Sunak and the role of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in U.K. politics. 
In the second part of the episode, Kara and Freedland are joined by yet another Jonathan: Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. The trio discusses the rise of populism and hate speech today. They cover Kanye West’s antisemitic remarks on social media and discuss Freedland’s — aka British Jonathan’s — new book, “The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World.”

      <title>The Economy Stinks, and Dr. Doom is Not Hopeful</title>
      <description>Nouriel Roubini, a.ka. "Dr. Doom," became famous for predicting the 2008 global financial crisis. Now, he is back with another grim forecast, in his new book, "MegaThreats: Ten Dangerous Trends That Imperil Our Future, And How to Survive Them." He and Kara discuss the book, his prediction that we’re headed towards a stagflationary debt crisis, and US-China relations. Dr. Roubini also explains why cryptocurrency is fundamentally flawed (in fact, he thinks it’s less sophisticated than what the Flinstone’s had). 
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema discuss Sheryl Sandberg’s new report, “Women in the Workplace,” a joint venture by her organization, Lean In, and McKinsey &amp; Company. And they  talk about China’s president Xi Jinping — who is leaning into a third term as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

      <title>Airbnb’s CEO on Nomadic Life, Loneliness… and Cleaning Fees</title>
      <description>Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky took the company public, laid off 25% of its staff and navigated worker demands for flexibility – all during the pandemic. Oh, and his mom moved in (and made him quiche every day). In this conversation with Kara, Brian discusses the challenge of being professionally successful and, sometimes, personally lonely. They talk about how the pandemic may have permanently changed how we work, travel and live. And Kara gets answers about the company’s lack of transparency on those dreaded cleaning fees. 

Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about billionaires owning social media networks. They discuss Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who seems to be riding the MAGA train to amass power in the Republican party. And they reflect on the story of Iranian rock climber Elnaz Rekabi, who caused a stir on social media this week in the midst of the nation’s anti-government protests. 

… oh yes, and they dispense some dating advice. If you want advice – it doesn’t have to be about dating – call 1-888-KARA-PLZ!

And Kara gets answers about the company’s lack of transparency on those dreaded cleaning fees. </p><p><br></p><p>Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about billionaires owning social media networks. They discuss Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who seems to be riding the MAGA train to amass power in the Republican party. And they reflect on the story of Iranian rock climber Elnaz Rekabi, who caused a stir on social media this week in the midst of the nation’s anti-government protests. </p><p><br></p><p>… oh yes, and they dispense some dating advice.

      <title>The Billionaire Who Took America Online</title>
      <description>Kara and Steve Case go back — way back, to the 1990s. She was a young Washington Post reporter covering a new thing called “the Internet” … and he was a co-founder of the company that became AOL. In this conversation, they take a walk back through time to look at how far the world has come and where tech companies have stumbled or fallen flat. They discuss Case’s new book, “Rise of the Rest,” which offers an optimistic future for the expansion of entrepreneurship and innovation beyond a handful of places like Silicon Valley, Boston and New York City. They also discuss whether a more equitable distribution of economic growth is possible, given some of the nation’s political divides — and potential solutions for bridging those divides. 
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about the newsmakers of the day, including Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, who is seeking a new trial, and the deep pockets of “anti-woke” investors in Silicon Valley including, of course, Peter Thiel. As always, Kara offers unsolicited advice.

      <title>Will Stacey Abrams (Finally) Win?</title>
      <description>It feels like deja vu. Stacey Abrams is running for governor of Georgia, again … against Brian Kemp, again. The two last faced off in a heated contest in 2018, with Kemp’s win hanging on 54,723 votes. This time, he’s an incumbent and even further ahead in the polls. So, Kara asks Abrams: what is different now?

Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about newsmakers – from the LA City Council members to the artist formerly known as Kanye West. And afterward, Kara answers a listener question about how she got so damn confident.

      <title>John Fetterman and Kara Talk Strokes, Recovery &amp; Senate Race</title>
      <description>Pennsylvania Lt. Governor and Senate candidate John Fetterman and Kara share a few things in common. As she puts it: they were both born in Pennsylvania, both wear sloppy clothes and both have survived a stroke. Kara’s hit 11 years ago, while Fetterman’s came last May. But for Fetterman, who is recovering steadily, that health incident has been weaponized against him in the race against Dr. Oz. In this conversation, Fetterman explains why it won't stop him in a contest that is critical for Democrats — one of the party’s best shots at flipping a seat and maintaining control of the Senate.  
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about Elon Musk’s latest antics, including efforts to make the Twitter deal contingent on financing and dabbling in Russia-Ukraine peace plans. They also look at the jam that President Biden finds himself in 4 weeks before the midterms, and Kara offers unsolicited advice to ... everybody.

      <title>Maggie Haberman Makes Sense of Donald Trump</title>
      <description>Donald Trump has said journalist Maggie Haberman is like his “psychiatrist” — a remark she dismisses as a meaningless and failed attempt at flattery. Yet Haberman does have a deep understanding of what makes the former president tick, cultivated through years of covering City Hall in New York City and then Donald J. Trump for The New York Times. Her recent book, “Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,” tells Trump’s origin story and chronicles his unexpected takeover of the Republican party and his consolidation of power in Washington. “He’s not a political genius,” Haberman tells Kara, “he is a genius about human emotions and a certain darkness in what animates people.” So will Trump run again in 2024? Haberman says that “he’s backed himself into a corner where he has to,” but she’s not sure whether she'll be covering him.
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about the newsmakers: Elon Musk’s about-face on the Twitter deal and Peter Thiel’s financing foray into key Senate races and ... a conservative dating app.

      <title>So ... Should We Ban TikTok?</title>
      <description>Kara loves air fryer TikToks. But she only dares to scroll through them on a burner phone, as she tells TikTok’s Chief Operating Officer, Vanessa Pappas. 
As the social media platform has gone gangbusters – accumulating over a billion monthly users globally – concerns have emerged about TikTok’s ownership structure and roots in China. The U.S. government has questions about what data the app is amassing, whether that data can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party and if the platform is a tool for espionage or foreign interference and propaganda. Kara has those questions too. And she asks Pappas all of them.
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about the newsmakers of the day. They scan through the Elon Musk text messages released in the Twitter-Musk proceedings and explore what the texts reveal about Silicon Valley’s powerful elite – including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. They also discuss recent layoffs at Meta – and how Mark Zuckerberg will navigate the company’s recent struggles without his former right-hand exec, Sheryl Sandberg.

      <title>Hillary Clinton Lets Loose with Predictions </title>
      <description>This is Kara’s 5th interview with Hillary Clinton. So what’s changed since their first conversation in 2015? According to Kara, it’s that the former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee for President has “run out of f***s." In this conversation, taped live at The Texas Tribune Festival, Kara notes that many of Clinton’s past predictions about Donald Trump have come through and asks what may unfold if Trump runs again in 2024. They discuss Hillary’s role in the Democratic Party, and the upcoming midterms. And they talk about the emails (again), with Kara laying out one conservative narrative that seeks to equate Clinton’s emails with the documents Trump stashed away at Mar-a-Lago. As Hillary puts it: “I have testified for 11 hours. I would love to see Donald Trump testify for 30 minutes in public about any of this.”

Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about newsmakers – from Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell’s decision to back a bill that would overhaul how Congress counts electoral votes to Giorgia Meloni’s win in Italy. They also run down things they’ve found despicable, delightful – or both – this week. Plus, Kara gives some advice. This time: it’s solicited.

      <itunes:summary>This is Kara’s 5th interview with Hillary Clinton. So what’s changed since their first conversation in 2015? According to Kara, it’s that the former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee for President has “run out of f***s." In this conversation, taped live at The Texas Tribune Festival, Kara notes that many of Clinton’s past predictions about Donald Trump have come through and asks what may unfold if Trump runs again in 2024. They discuss Hillary’s role in the Democratic Party, and the upcoming midterms. And they talk about the emails (again), with Kara laying out one conservative narrative that seeks to equate Clinton’s emails with the documents Trump stashed away at Mar-a-Lago. As Hillary puts it: “I have testified for 11 hours. I would love to see Donald Trump testify for 30 minutes in public about any of this.”

Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema talk about newsmakers – from Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell’s decision to back a bill that would overhaul how Congress counts electoral votes to Giorgia Meloni’s win in Italy. They also run down things they’ve found despicable, delightful – or both – this week. Plus, Kara gives some advice. This time: it’s solicited.

      <title>Chris Cuomo’s Comeback</title>
      <description>Kara Swisher is back — and so, it seems, is Chris Cuomo. In an interview that is frank and feisty, Kara presses the former CNN anchor on his unceremonious exit from the network last year, and they discuss whether he can cut through the noise with his new podcast, “The Chris Cuomo Project,” and a forthcoming show on NewsNation.

But first, Kara and her sidekick, exec producer Nayeema Raza, the “Goose to her Maverick” (and yes, Goose eventually died in Top Gun) chat about the newsmakers and news Kara is watching — from Google CEO Sundar Pichai to journalist Christiane Amanpour. Kara also weighs in on the drama around the cartoon strip, Dilbert. And, finally, she offers some unsolicited advice about covering celebrity sext scandals.
